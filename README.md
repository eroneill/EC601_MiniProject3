## DSP Visualization options 
 This project contains code for 2 different DSP visualization types in Python.  

 Typical engineering students are used to using MATLAB software for its strong digital signal processings capabilities but after school may find that licensing costs for the full MATLAB suite can be prohibitively expensive.  Python offers free packages that have the same capabilities as MATLAB without the cost.  

## Software Packages 

The first example uses matplotlib (which is clearly named to indicate its similarity to MATLAB).  This is contained in the MPL.ipynb file.  
The second example uses Bokeh.  This is a newer and more polished visualization package.  It does not look like MATLAB and might be more useful for presentations than matplotlib.  This demo is contained in the BKH.ipynb file.  

Both of these software demos are based on simple signals (MPL) or example data (BKH) and are simply intented to be demonstrations of the capabilities of the tools not unique or interesting digital signal analyses.  

## Conclusions

MPL is a much more simple plotting tool that will be easy for any programmer with a knowlege of python and/or Matlab.  After spending a few days, though, with Bokeh - it is clear to me that spending a little extra effort opens up lots more options and tools for prettier and more interactive visualizations.
